  <h1>Help Us Translate Tab Space</h1>
  <p>It is great to use localized software and often makes us more comfortable. We would like to offer support for more languages in Tab Space. But we speak very few languages ourselves. So it is very appreciated if you could help us to translate Tab Space.</p>
  <p>Basically, adding a translation is to append a block in the following file [<a href="https://github.com/yuanzhoucq/Tab-Space/blob/master/admin/src/lang.json">file</a>]. Or more specific, just translate the red quoted text under "en-us" label. If you kindly add a translation, please send it to joyuercn@icloud.com, we will add it to Tab Space very soon. Thanks!</p>
